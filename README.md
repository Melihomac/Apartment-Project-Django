# Apartment Project with Django

* This is a basic website application for Apartment Project.
* I used Python3 with Django.
* I prepared this website for Programming Languages class. I used sqllite as database. 
* I also used bootstrap for Html and Css.
* You can see the information of the apartments and edit them. 
* There is a special admin panel for you. You can showcase all of these on your website.

	**If you want to run project, you should write `python3 manage.py runserver` in your terminal. But be careful, Your directory must be in your project folder.**

	**If you want to see website, you should write `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.**
	
	**If you want to see admin panel, you should write `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser.**
